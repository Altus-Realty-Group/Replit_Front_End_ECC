# Database Architecture Record

Repository: Altus-Realty-Group/Replit_Front_End_ECC
Standard: [Altus Supabase Architecture Standard](ALTUS_SUPABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md), version 1.0.0
Record status: Documentation bootstrap; domain inventory and live database binding are UNVERIFIED.
Last evidence review: 2026-10-02 (repository instructions only)

This record does not assert that the application uses Supabase or that its schema is inefficient. Read existing schema, migrations, contracts and architecture documentation before completing the affected domain. Preserve established contracts and link existing records instead of duplicating them. Populate the affected slice in the next database-related PR; an unfilled section is not authority to invent entities or block unrelated work.

## Authority and deployment

| Item | Evidence / status |
| --- | --- |
| Owning application / domain | Not inventoried |
| Supabase project and environment, if applicable | Unverified; confirm from current non-secret configuration and live evidence |
| Other data stores / owning backend | Not inventoried; preserve current ownership until verified |
| Migration and generated-type locations | Not inventoried |
| Repo versus live schema drift | Not checked |
| Existing architecture / ADR / contract links | Add verified links before changing the affected domain |

## Entity and relationship inventory

For each affected table/view/RPC, record: actual name and evidence ref; business purpose and row grain; canonical owner; PK/FKs and cardinality; uniqueness/checks and units; lifecycle/retention; RLS/grants; actual writers/readers; cache/snapshot status; related migrations. Distinguish source-declared, local migrated and live-verified facts. Add a Mermaid relationship diagram only from verified keys and cardinality.

## Read and write paths

| Business operation | UI/API caller | Query/RPC and canonical owner | Cache/invalidation and revision | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not yet inventoried | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | No operation traced |

## Values, assumptions and update behavior

| Field/domain | Source and units | Override scope / precedence | Clear/reset/reapply | Default propagation / snapshot version | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not yet inventoried | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unverified |

Record applicability for existing and future scenarios, zero/null semantics, who may edit, conflict policy and reload/recalculation behavior. Do not bake scenario-number exceptions into the common resolver without a justified domain requirement.

## Efficiency baseline

| Operation and caller role | Workload/environment | Requests / rows / bytes | SQL and end-to-end latency | Evidence / limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not measured | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | No performance claim |

## Decisions, cleanup and compatibility

| Decision / affected objects | Reuse alternatives / rationale | Added / changed / retired | Consumer sequence / compatibility owner and removal trigger | PR / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard adoption | Establish a maintained design record before extending persistence | Documentation only | Inventory affected domain during next DB task | Initial adoption PR |

Record retention and dependency proof before retirement. Link larger decisions to existing ADRs or docs/database/decisions/. Preserve financial/legal custody.

## Verification and open work

- Complete the affected-domain inventory from actual source and verified database evidence when available.
- Trace representative read/write operations and changes through reload and recalculation.
- Measure before claiming efficiency gains; retain evidence limitations.
- Keep this record current in the same PR as architectural changes.

This bootstrap changes documentation only. It neither audits nor modifies operational data, schema, runtime, credentials or deployment.
